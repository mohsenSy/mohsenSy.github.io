## Linux Systems Administrator

I love working on Linux systems it has been my passion for many years.
My favorite Linux distro is Ubuntu, I have done many tasks on Ubuntu and always looking forward for new challenges.

**DevOps** is my among my interests too, it is great how developers and operations team can cooperate together in
the software delivery process to create better products for end users and deploy code more frequently to production
environment without any bugs through a nice pipeline from *development* to *review*, *staging*, *QA* then *production*.

This process would not be possible except for some great tools in the DevOps **tool chain** which includes:

* [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) for local development environment which is identical between all developers.
* [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) which can be used to run [Ansible](https://ansible.com) playbooks used to deploy code to different
environments
* [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and [grafana](https://grafana.com) can be used to monitor our servers and
create custom alerts.

Troubleshoot mysql NDB cluster issues including node failures, queries failing because of bad configuration
and optimizing the queries by using indexes.

Apply browser caching to improve user experience and currently working on using [varnish](https://varnish-cache.org) to cache resources at server side.

Planning to use [memcached](https://memcached.org) with mysql cluster to cache frequent queries and improve end user's experience.
