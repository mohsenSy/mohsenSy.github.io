My name is Mouhsen Ibrahim, I work as Linux Systems Administrator for Shamra Syrian Project where
I managed a pool of servers to provide services for our web application including database, search
and file clusters for High Availability, Fault Tolerant and Scalable systems.

**Linux** has been my passion for many years, I am a very good self learner almost everything I know
about Linux was a result of self efforts, at the start of 2017 I started learning **DevOps** and used
many modern tools such as **Docker**, **Ansible**, **Gitlab CI** and many more.
