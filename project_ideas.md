Here I will post project ideas for graduation and semester projects in Information Engineering Faculty

# Projects I can supervise

* Own Private Cloud: This project aims to create a private cloud platform from zero to finish,
  it offers basic cloud services such as VMs, networks, storage etc... and managed services
  such as VPN, Database, Web Cluster, etc...,it requires a highly skillful team and a lot of work. **difficulty 10/10**
* Building a Client and Server for an application protocol using C++: Every application protocol like HTTP, SMTP,
  LDAP, DNS, etc... has implementations using different languages, here we want to take the hard work by our selves
  and create a server that can implement a protocol and maybe surpass the performance of other serves. **difficulty 10/10**
* Building a caching HTTP load balancer using C++: The most famous HTTP load balancer (haproxy) does not include the ability
  to cache responses, here we want to create a HTTP proxy called proxyHttp for example and it should support many features
  including different load balancing algorithms, logging capabilities, high performance proxy and caching server. **difficulty 10/10**
* Ansible deployments: This project is an improvement over ansible tool to enable it to deploy clusters of servers
  as a whole with minimal interaction from systems administrators. **difficulty 9/10**
* Ansible tower alternative: This project aims to create a web interface to run ansible using it for visualizing
  the automation of the entire infrastructure using ansible tool. **difficulty 8/10**
* Automating the deployment of web infrastructure: This project includes the deployment of highly available, scalable
  and fault tolerant web infrastructure which includes: load balancers, web servers, database cluster, file clusters etc...
  all of this should happen using automation tools such as ansible. **difficulty 8/10**
* Performance evaluation of Redis and RabbitMQ: Redis and RabbitMQ can be used in publish/subscribe mode where programs (clients)
  can subscribe to a queue or channel and wait to be notified about messages being sent to those queues, we will use or create a tool
  to generate load on the serves and test response time with how many events can be processed in a second etc.... **difficulty 8/10**
* A monitoring cluster using Prometheus: A previous team (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aloush.shash.3">Ali Ibraheem Shash</a> and
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mayosh.ismaeel.5">Maya F Ismaeel</a>) did a project using Prometheus monitoring server,
  in this continuation project we will create a cluster of Prometheus servers and use it to monitor Database Clusters, web servers
  and many more... **difficulty 7/10** *not available*
* Chat application: In this project we will build a fast and scalable chat app using micro-services, this app will have the ability
  to create private and group chats with user profiles and additional features to help development teams communicate with each other. **difficulty 7/10**
* Web interface for DPI: Deep Packet Inspection works on analyzing network packets and extracting information from them, in this project we will build
  a python module for inspecting some common application protocol packets such as HTTP, DNS, etc... and API to use the module and a web interface
  that calls the API, at the end we will have a web application for reading pcap files and displaying them in a web browser interface. **difficulty 7/10**
* Performance evaluation of Database clusters and load balancers: A previous team (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aalaa.elbishiny.1">Aalaa Albesheny</a> and
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ibrahim.Alfeel">Ibrahim M Alfeel</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/taimaaib">
  Taimaa Ibraheem</a>) did a project about the deployment of database clusters using NDB and percona cluster
  with haproxy and proxysql load balancer, here in this project we will use their work after getting their permission and evaluate
  the performance of read versus write operations using NDB and percona with proxysql and haproxy load balancers. **difficulty 6/10**
* DCOS: DCOS is a distributed cloud operating system that can be used to deploy software on multiple machines and manage them from a single
  interface it uses Apache Mesos as low level backend for scheduling work loads on servers. **difficulty 6/10**
* Storage Clusters: This project we will deploy two types of storage clusters, GlusterFS and LizardFS and compare them. **difficulty 6/10**

# Projects I cannot supervise
* Paralyzing algorithms with MapReduce: MapReduce is a distributed computing framework which allows to divide applications
  into tasks and sending these tasks to multiple machines and getting results from all of them, here an algorithm
  will be selected and implemented using MapReduce. **difficulty 9/10**
* Video Game: A previous project by (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ali.ratel">Ali Ratel</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hasansan88">
  Hasan Alkhayer</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emad.king.5015"> Emad Eslamboly</a>) created a video game using Unity Game Engine,
  we can get their permission to use the code and improve the game.
* Image Search Engine: A previous project by (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/adam.oudaimah">
  Adam Oudaimah</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010620545280">
  أكرم قاسم</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010602547873">Mohammad Ali</a>), created a ML model
  for captioning images, in this project we will build a web application that crawls images on the web, convert them
  to text and store them in a database then make it searchable using the web interface. **difficulty 9/10**
